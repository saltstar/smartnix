// remain consistent with the RFC 4122 definition of UUIDs. The UUID is 128 bits made up of 32
// bit time low, 16 bit time mid, 16 bit time high and 64 bit clock sequence and node fields. RFC
// 4122 states that when encoding a UUID as a sequence of bytes, each field will be encoded in
// network byte order. This class stores the data as a sequence of bytes.
