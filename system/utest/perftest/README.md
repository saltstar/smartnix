# Perf Tests

These are Zircon's performance tests.
When using a Fuchsia build, the tests can be run with
`/system/test/sys/perf-test`.
When using a standalone Zircon build the tests can be run with
`/boot/test/sys/perf-test`.


For examples of how to use the testing framework, as well as coding guidelines,
please read:
[perftest.h](/system/ulib/perftest/include/perftest/perftest.h)
